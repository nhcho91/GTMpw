# GTMpw

Over the past decades, the Generic Transport Model (GTM) developed by NASA and Boeing (https://software.nasa.gov/software/LAR-17625) has contributed significantly to analysis and control approaches of civil aircraft. This repository provides an open-source, full-envelope model of the aerodynamic coefficients and equations of motions of the GTM by piece-wise polynomial data fitting.
